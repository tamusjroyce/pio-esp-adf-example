# PlatformIO ESP-ADF example

This includes binary codecs, some of which have patents. Be aware this is not completely an open source project. But it is still an excellent example. Codecs look like they come from the Android project.

## Building

Look into the `platformio.ini` to understand how building works and what you have to change.
